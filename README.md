# AwesomeOS

AwesomeOS is a real-time operating system written for the BeagleBone hardware. It is still in really, really early development.

Features currently working:

* Processor initialization
* Interrupts
* UART0 Tx

Planned feaures:
* Some sort of shell environment
* DMA
* Preemptive multitasking with some sort of realtime guarantees
* Virtual memory
* Privilege levels and system calls
* Additional hardware peripherals
* SD card and FAT support
* ELF binary loading???
